Understanding these attributes is important for assessing data quality and gaining a preliminary context. We explore the temporal structure, summary statistics, and distribution patterns to create a baseline understanding of your data.",
  "trend_section_header": "Trend",
  "trend_section_intro": "Trend refers to the long-term change in the mean level of a time series. It reflects systematic and gradual changes in the data over time. Understanding the trend is important for identifying long-term growth or decline, structural changes, and making informed modeling decisions. This section examines the characteristics of the trend of the time series.",
  "seasonality_section_header": "Seasonality",
  "seasonality_section_intro": "Seasonality represents recurring patterns or cycles that appear at regular intervals in time series data. These are predictable fluctuations that reflect periodic influences such as monthly, quarterly, or yearly cycles. Understanding seasonal patterns is crucial for forecasting, trend analysis, and identifying anomalies. This section examines the presence, strength, and characteristics of seasonal components in the input time series.",
  "variance_section_header": "Variance",
  "variance_section_intro": "Variance measures how data points spread around the average value in your time series. This section examines whether the variability remains stable (homoskedastic) or changes (heteroskedastic) over time. Understanding variance patterns is crucial for selecting appropriate modeling techniques, which can have a significant impact on forecasting accuracy.",
  "change_section_header": "Change Detection",
  "change_section_intro": "Change points denote significant shifts in the underlying distribution of time series. These structural changes can manifest as sudden shifts in level, trend, variance, or seasonal patterns. Detecting and understanding these points is crucial as they often indicate important events or regime changes that affect modeling decisions. This section identifies potential change points and assesses their impact on the overall analysis strategy.",
